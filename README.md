### AI
[AwesomeAI](https://github.com/hades217/awesome-ai): A very nice summary about AI courses, that I will just add some things to.  
[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ "DeepLearning.AI"): Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization course.  
[Math for AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning): You all know, I'm a mathematician... So, of yourse I will bring up this course.  
[Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models): Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are a rich framework for encoding probability distributions over complex domains: joint (multivariate) distributions over large numbers of random variables that interact with each other. These representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more.  
[Recommender Systems](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems): A Recommender System is a process that seeks to predict user preferences.  
[Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow)  

### Data Science and Statistics
[Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)  
[Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)  
[Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)  
[Bayesian statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics): An introduction to Bayesian and classical statistics.  
[Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mcmc-bayesian-statistics)  
[Practical Time Series Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-time-series-analysis)  
[A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality)  

### Computer Science
[Data structures and algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms): As I always tell my students in my "Advanced data models" lecture: "Many model thinkers are the best thinkers"...  
[Computational thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving)  

### Optimization
[Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization)  

### Web Development
